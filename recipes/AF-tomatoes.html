        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Garlic, Parmesan cheese, fresh basil, and toasted nuts turn brown rice into a superstar stuffing in this Italian-inspired stuffed tomato side dish that's 
            cooked in the air fryer.</p>
        <p>Using the air fryer to prepare Italian tomatoes is ideal for those looking for a faster and healthier method compared to the oven. The hot air circulation
            in the appliance ensures even and efficient cooking, with less oil needed. This technique intensifies the tomato's natural flavors and brings out its fresh 
            qualities, making this snack a perfect choice to accompany salads, pastas or simply as a tasty and light appetizer.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 medium tomatoes</li>
            <li>olive oil, as needed</li>
            <li>1 cup cooked brown rice</li>
            <li>1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup crumbled goat cheese</li>
            <li>1/4 cup chopped toasted walnuts</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh basil, divided, or more to taste</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1/4 cup Italian-seasoned bread crumbs, divided</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut tops off tomatoes and scoop out flesh with a melon baller, leaving 1/4- to 1/2-inch thick sides and bottoms. Discard tomato tops and flesh.</li>
            <li>Brush the bottom of an air fryer basket with olive oil.</li>
            <li>Combine cooked rice, Parmesan cheese, goat cheese, walnuts, 1 tablespoon basil, and garlic in a medium bowl. Combine bread crumbs, and 1 tablespoon 
                olive oil in a small bowl. Fill tomatoes with rice mixture, then sprinkle with bread crumb mixture. Place stuffed tomatoes into the prepared air fryer basket.</li>
            <li>Cook in the air fryer at 370 degrees F (188 degrees C) until tomatoes are tender, filling is heated through, and topping is golden brown, about 15 minutes. 
                Garnish with remaining basil.</li>
