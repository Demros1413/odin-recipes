        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Rotisserie chicken is a cooking classic that combines simplicity with exceptional flavor. It is a whole chicken seasoned with a blend of herbs and spices, 
            such as rosemary, thyme, garlic and paprika, which is slowly cooked in the oven until the skin is crispy and golden brown, while the meat remains juicy 
            and tender. The key to a perfectly roasted chicken is to make sure the bird is well seasoned and cooked to the right temperature, allowing the juices to 
            redistribute during the cooking process.</p>
            
        <p>Accompanied by vegetables such as potatoes, carrots and onions, which are cooked along with the chicken, this dish becomes a 
            complete and comforting meal. The combination of browned meat and caramelized vegetables creates a delicious and satisfying culinary experience, ideal 
            for family dinners or special gatherings. Served with a sauce made from the cooking juices, rotisserie chicken offers a deep, satisfying flavor that 
            everyone will love.</p>
