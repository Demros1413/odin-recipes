        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Ultimate Low-Carb Zucchini Lasagna is a delicious version of the classic Italian lasagna, designed for those looking to reduce their carbohydrate intake 
            without sacrificing flavor. Instead of traditional pasta sheets, this recipe uses thin slices of zucchini as a substitute, which are baked until tender 
            and lightly caramelized. The filling combines ground beef seasoned with Italian herbs, a rich tomato sauce and a creamy blend of cheeses such as ricotta 
            and mozzarella, offering an indulgent texture and flavor that mimics conventional lasagna.</p>
            
        <p>The result is a satisfying dish that preserves the essence of traditional lasagna while conforming to a low-carb profile. The zucchini not only contributes 
            a light texture, but also absorbs the flavors of the sauce and cheese well, creating a balanced and delicious culinary experience. Ideal for those following
            a ketogenic or low-carb diet, this zucchini lasagna is an excellent choice for enjoying comfort food without compromising health and nutrition goals.</p>
