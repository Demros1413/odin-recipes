#BASIC RECIPES

## Description
In this project I am going to demonstrate by means of HTML language how much I have progressed in that coding language so far in the introductory course. 
This project aims to help more people to make delicious recipes, it will provide them with the ingredients they will need, how to make it.
As for what I have learned so far, I feel that it will be reflected in the deliverable, you can see what I have learned as the basic structure of HTML, how to anchor links or images, call those elements that are in other directories, also the concepts learned so far.
